<p id="box2">first you will need to find a village when you are in the village you will need to find wood and stone to make stone tools and then you will need to collect beds wich you will need later and get bread which you can make with the hay thats in the village and you need to kill a iron golem that is in the village too kill it you will need to go 3 blocks up so he cant kill you and if there is a blacksmith in the village then you should open the chest that is inside the blacksmith when you have gotten everything you need then you will have to make a bucket and you will need to find a flint by breaking gravel. then you will need to make a portal click on the picture to see a video on how to make a nether portal.</p>

<p id="box6">you need alot of luck in the nether,first you will have to find a nether fortress and kill blazes and get 7 blaze rods from them, if you see a bastion then you should go in that one and get gold and trade with the piglings that are inside by throwing gold at them and get 14 ender eyes but 12 is also okey but you will need more luck later if you only get 12 there is a 5% chance of getting ender pearls from piglings. once you have gotten everything that you need from the nether you will have to get back to your portal or build a new one if you have enough obsidian.</p>

<p id="box10">once you have gotten out of the nether you will have make ender eyes by making blaze powder with the blaze rods and combining that with the eyes. then you will have to right click with the eyes in your hands and the eyes will show you where to go there is a 20% chance that the ender eye breaks when you throw. you should throw it again when you have walked 1000 blocks when the ender pearl goes down you will to dig down to the stronghold and you should dig down at 44 which if you press f3 and look at the chunk and have the first and the last number be 4 then if you are in the right chunk then you will dig directly down into the starting staircase which is always 5-7 rooms away from the end portal when you are at the end portal you will have to put all your ender eyes inside the slots if you dont have enough ender eyes then you can find some in the stronhold chests that are around the stronghold if your lucky. if you click on the picture it will take you to a video on how to kill the ender dragon fast.</p>
